# Ahoy

A design tool that makes Teamleader work smarter.

<Story name="Introduction" />

## Say what?

Ahoy! is a UI pattern library that makes us build consistent, user-friendly solutions for small SME's. We call it 'Ahoy!' because the kid needed a name and it reflects the goal of this tool: guide anyone working on Teamleader products.

It is the result of an effort to evovle from a disconnected product design approach to a living pattern library that closes the loop between design and development.
